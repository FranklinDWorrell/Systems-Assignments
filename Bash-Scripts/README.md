##Description
Three Bash scripts. One compares the contents of two directories provided by the user. The second takes a username from the user and reports how many times that user is logged into the system. The third polls the list of currently running processes and prints those belonging to the current user, refreshing the display every 2 seconds. 

Written for undergraduate course in Systems Programming Concepts (CSCI 2467) in Spring 2016.
